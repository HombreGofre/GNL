# Get_Next_Line
Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor - 42 Cursus 

This function returns a line from a [fd](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/file-descriptor.htm#:~:text=A%20file%20descriptor%20is%20a,Grants%20access.). In this case, it will return the following line each time we execute it.

In the bonus part, we will have to use a single static variable and be able to read several fd at the same time. 

The external functions that are allowed are: [malloc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/free.3.html) / [read](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html) / [free](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/free.1.html)
